<span><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-316192?style=flat&logo=MYSQL&logoColor=white" /></span>

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive training dataset for MySQL in bioinformatics, generated by artificial intelligence. It includes a full-featured database schema, mock data, and a collection of SQL scripts for queries, views, functions, and stored procedures.

---

## Database Structure
The main database schema is defined in `Bioinformatics_Advanced_DB.sql`. It includes the following tables:

- **Organisms**: Stores organism names and taxonomy.
- **Genes**: Stores gene information, linked to organisms.
- **Proteins**: Stores protein information, linked to genes.
- **Sequences**: Stores protein sequences.
- **Diseases**: Stores disease names and descriptions.
- **GeneDiseases**: Links genes to diseases (many-to-many).
- **ProteinDiseases**: Links proteins to diseases (many-to-many).
- **Experiments**: Stores experiment details.
- **GeneExperiments**: Links genes to experiments.
- **ProteinExperiments**: Links proteins to experiments.
- **Variants**: Stores genetic variant information linked to genes.

---

## Folder Structure
- **Functions/**: Contains user-defined SQL functions for extracting specific information (e.g., gene functions, disease descriptions).
- **Queries/**: Contains example SQL queries for data analysis and retrieval.
- **Stored Procedures/**: Contains stored procedures for adding new data and retrieving complex information.
- **Views/**: Contains SQL views for simplified data access and reporting.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Use the `Bioinformatics_Advanced_DB.sql` file to create and populate the database in your MySQL server.
3. Explore the `Functions`, `Queries`, `Stored Procedures`, and `Views` folders to learn and practice advanced SQL techniques in a bioinformatics context.
